Facebook Falafel
============

Command line utility for Facebook, for the cool kids.

*Note* Facebook rejected our app. Thrice. So it's still not available for everyone to run. You can fork it and use it with your own app token if you wish. Until we find a workaround, that's the only way to use it. /: 

If you know us persoanlly (facebook friends) we'll happly make you a 'beta tester' so you can use it without forking.


# Install

Make sure you have node. Then

    npm install -g fb-falafel

BAM! Done.

# Usage

The first time you run `facebook`, you'll have to give it give it permission to create the config file. Do this by running:

    $ sudo facebook

And subsequently entering your password. After that, just run this anytime you want:

    $ facebook

BAM! That's it. Use the `--help` parameter for a list of options. Or just run it. Yeah.

# No but acutally...

Press `[spacebar]` to go to the next item. Press `h` for help. 

Press `[esc]` to enter command mode, and type in `help` there for command mode help.
